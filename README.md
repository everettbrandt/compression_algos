# compression_algos

This repo contains two files that demonstrate arithmetic and huffman encoding and decoding. These classes were used for a group final project in ECE 477 Multimedia Systems.
The arithmetic class only works for up to 14 unique characters. This is because of the 64 bit floating point in python is only so accurate. I'm working to optimize the performance
of both of these classes as well as fix the arithmetic encoder.
